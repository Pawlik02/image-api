# Image API
Simple API for uploading images in PNG or JPG format created as a recruitment task. App was written in Django REST Framework and using other additional Python libraries.

It took me about 12 hours to complete the task.
# Installation
Run these commands in your terminal to set up the app
```
git clone https://github.com/Pawlik02/image-api.git
cd image-api/
docker-compose up --build

```
Now you can access API on [htpp://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
